# Precog Programming task

## Todo
- look into label encoders
- finish the 2nd, 3rd chapter of ml with sklearn
- make a complete report of Delhi
- learn more about matplotlib
- make cdf's of the best fit curve so you can find probabilities
- filter all the domestic violence cases and calculate their (disposition
    days, pendency/disposition rates) for each district of delhi and year-wise

## Classification ideas
- predict when the next case will be filed
- classify judges into 'civil judge junior division' or 'civil judge senior division'
- predict the next filing date
- classify cases into criminal and civil

## rand
- hands on machine learning with scikit learn, keras and tensorflow

## Ideas
What are the fundamental problems in judiciary system ?
- cases take too long to be solved
- we need to use the judiciary data in police enforcement

#### Making the judiciary system better
- find which courts need more judges and of what kind (resource allocation)

- allocate cases to appropriate judges (basically judges who have handeled
that kind of cases before so judges can make better and faster judgement)

- we need to find in which places there are more crimes of a particular kind
and then take action accordingly [This is done kind of]

### analysis

#### Pending cases - Done
- how many pending cases are there in each court of a state vs the total
    number of cases filed in each state (bar graph or take ratios and make
    their bar graph)
- how many pending cases are there in each state vs the total number of
    cases filed in each state(heatmap)
- number of pending cases above a certain time (time since filing date)
- trend of pending cases in each state as years pass by (can be done
    separately for criminal and civil cases)

#### Average case completion time - Done
- the average number of days it takes for a case in a particular court (can
    be used by people to see which court they should go to). This will be
    done separately for criminal and civil cases
- the average days it takes for a case in a particular state (already done)
- trend of average case completion time in each state as years pass by

#### misc
- heatmap of state/district vs criminal cases against women
- how many cases against women were caused by men/women
- what is the gender ratio of judges in a state compared to the gender
ratio of the whole state
