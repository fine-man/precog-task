# Precog Programming task

## Todo
- read up how to handle big data well in pandas (chunksize and everything)
- filter all the acts related to women from acts_key.csv
- mail naman goel your progress and ask him for feedback

## Ideas

What are the fundamental problems in judiciary system ?
- cases take too long to be solved
- we need to use the judiciary data in police enforcement

#### Making the judiciary system better
- find which courts need more judges and of what kind (resource allocation)

- allocate cases to appropriate judges (basically judges who have handeled
that kind of cases before so judges can make better and faster judgement)

- we need to find in which places there are more crimes of a particular kind
and then take action accordingly

we need better resource allocation for courts, that is : we need to find
which courts need more judges and of what kind.

### analysis

#### Pending cases
- how many pending cases are there in each court of a state vs the total
    number of cases filed in each state (bar graph or take ratios and make
    their bar graph)
- how many pending cases are there in each state vs the total number of
    cases filed in each state(heatmap)
- number of pending cases above a certain time (time since filing date)
- trend of pending cases in each state as years pass by (can be done
    separately for criminal and civil cases)

#### Average case completion time
- the average number of days it takes for a case in a particular court (can
    be used by people to see which court they should go to). This will be
    done separately for criminal and civil cases
- the average days it takes for a case in a particular state (already done)
- trend of average case completion time in each state as years pass by

#### misc
- heatmap of state/district vs criminal cases against women
- how many cases against women were caused by men/women
- what is the gender ratio of judges in a state compared to the gender
ratio of the whole state
