## State Rankings
To evaluate the performance of the judiciary in different states, 
we will use three different metrics

- `Case Pendency Rate`
- `Cases Per Judge`
- `Mean Disposition Days`

A lower value for each of these metrics indicates that the judiciary of that 
state is more efficient. 

It's also worth noting that looking at the case pendency rate, average number 
of cases per judge and time taken to dispose of cases over the years can give 
us a general idea of the court system's performance but it's important to 
consider other factors such as the resources available to the court system, 
and the cultural and socio-economic context of the state when interpreting 
the results.

Sikkim is the best in all three categories.
