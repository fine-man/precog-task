# Analysis

## Basic Idea for all analysis
- figure out how to improve court performance and efficiency
- use the data to figure out where do we need stricter regulation for
certain things and where we don't

## 1st Analysis - does number of judges affect decision time/pending cases
we will look at the following things and make decisions
we will plot the data of total cases/number of judges vs mean decision time
- number of judges per district court
- number of pending cases per court
- number of decided cases per court
- total number of cases per court
- mean number of days between filing and decision

## 2nd Analysis - A report of New Delhi
