# Analysis

## Basic Idea for all analysis
- figure out how to improve court performance and efficiency
- use the data to figure out where do we need stricter regulation for
certain things and where we don't

## At country level
- graphing the number of cases filed for crime against women over the
years, this has the problem of the cases going up linearly because
there is just more data about the latest years with respect to the old
times
- trying to graph the crime which is most in "trend" which happens the
most, basically figuring out which crimes are getting more or less
prevelant
- find the pdf of indian judicial system

## At States level
- ranking different states based on a bunch of criterias (no data map, just
sorted bar graphs), the criterias are - mean disposition time, case
pendency rate, case disposition rate and mean workload of judges

- making a data map of the number of cases against women violence filed for
each of the states (can vary the number of years taken).

- ranking the states based on women safety. The criterias for women safety
are : number of cases filed/per population, average pendency rate,
mean disposition time

### Trends over the years (state wise)
- graphing case disposition rate over the years
- graphing case pendency rate over the years
- number of cases against women filed over the years

## At districts level (will be looking at all the districts)
- making a data-map of the case disposition rate (already done)
- making data maps for women voilence
- making data map for case pendency rate

## At state level
- graphing number of pending cases, judges, mean decision days per district
(bar graphs)
- think of each court's disposition time as a random variable and then
apply clt over all the data of a particular court.

### Trends over the years (per district of a particular state)
All of these will be line graphs over the years and each line on the graph
will represent a separate district of a particular state
- graphing case disposition rate over the years
- graphing case pendency rate over the years
- graphing mean disposition time over the years
- number of cases against women filed over the years
- workload of judges over the years (total cases/number of judges)

## 2nd Analysis - A report of New Delhi
- number of pending cases in each court
- mean number of days between filing and decision
- number of judges in each court
- number of cases filed under women domestic violence
- number of cases filed under various other acts
