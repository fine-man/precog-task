# PreCog Programming Task

## Some terminology

> Case Pendency rate : The ratio of the number of pending cases and the total cases filed

> Case Disposition rate : Same as case pendency rate but this is the ratio of number of disposed (decided) cases and the total cases filed

> Mean Disposition days : The average number of days it took to dispose off a case. In other words, this is the mean difference between date of decision and date of filing

#### Best Fit PDF
- [Best Fit Probability Density Function For Disposition Days (2018)](https://imgur.com/a/33VYQc2) <br>
Here, I have looked at all the solved cases of 2018 and plotted a histogram of
the of difference between the decision date and the filing date. After that
I found the best fit probability density function for that histogram.
Using the best fit pdf, we can answer questions such as what is the
approximate probability that a case will be solved between date `A` and 
date `B`.
